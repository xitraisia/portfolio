        “So many people will tell you ”no”, 
        and you need to find something you believe in 
        so hard that you just smile and tell them ”watch me”. 
        Learn to take rejection as motivation to prove people wrong. 
        Be unstoppable. Refuse to give up, no matter what. It’s the best 
        skill you can ever learn.” 
        ― Charlotte Eriksson</h3>

    Welcome to my portfolio. This webpage is a snippet of my vibrant personality
    and all the things that make me who I am. Recent Georgia State graduate with an anthropology
    degree I felt like something was missing. I wanted to do something that would keep me
    constantly challenged so I decided to pursue my masters in information technology. 
    One of the requirements for the application was to create a code. And that's when I 
    discovered a developer's world and began investing my time in learning HTML, CSS, Python 
    and Javascript. I am self taught and open to constanlty learning. Life is nothing without 
    challenges.Im an architect at heart. I love to design and build and push the boundaries 
    of what it means to be in a box. I enjoyed creating all of these projects. The home page 
    consists of a collage of pictures from different aspects of my creative mind; What motivates me,
    what inspires me, what keeps me going. Although I am not a mother, motherhood is what inspires me
    to keep pushing because I want to be an inspiration to my future kids and lead by example. Every
    picture is dear to my heart and shows a little glimpse of my character. My about page as 
    you could already tell is a little bit about me. My projects page is a composition of all the 
    projects that I have created, including this webpage. I fought with every ounce of me with everything
    I created on this page. I missed meals, sometimes I wanted to throw my computer. But there is just 
    something about having a vision that you just have to see come to life. There are a lot of things
    I have explored during this time. Each picture that is included in my collage is a part of me that is 
    very dear to my heart but also an explanation of my charater. And although I am not a mother, motherhood
    is a huge motivation for me because I want to be an example to my future kids. I want to lead by example.
    <br>
    And that..... That, is what fuels my tenacity. I am so excited for what you all are about to 
    discover. Thank you for taking the time out to check out my work.
